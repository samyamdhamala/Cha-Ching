![Cha-Ching Logo](https://your-logo-url.com)  
*A Python-based personal expense tracker with file-based storage and budget management.*

## 📌 Project Overview
Cha-Ching $$ is a **Python-based personal expense tracking application** that allows users to log, categorize, and manage their daily expenses. The project uses **file-based storage (JSON)** for persistence, secure **password hashing (SHA-256)** for authentication, and a modular architecture for maintainability.

## 🚀 Features
### **User Management**
- Secure **registration & login** with password hashing.
- Admin & User roles with different permissions.

### **Expense Tracking**
- Users can **add, edit, delete, and view expenses**.
- Expenses are stored persistently in `data.json`.

### **Budget Management**
- Users can **set monthly budgets** and get warnings if exceeded.
- Budget tracking by period (e.g., `YYYY-MM`).

### **Category Management (Admin Only)**
- Admin can **create, update, and delete categories**.
- Users select categories for expenses.

### **File-Based Storage**
- No database required, all data is stored in `data.json`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.9+**
- **File-Based Storage (JSON)**
- **Password Hashing (SHA-256)**
- **Logging (app.log for user activity tracking)**
